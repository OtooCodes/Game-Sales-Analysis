# 🎮 Game Sales Analysis

This Jupyter Notebook provides a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) of global video game sales. It leverages Python's data science stack to uncover trends, correlations, and key insights in the gaming industry.

## 📊 Overview

The analysis includes:

* Data cleaning and preprocessing
* Exploratory visualizations using Seaborn and Matplotlib
* Insights into global sales by platform, genre, publisher, and region
* Handling missing data and preparing it for accurate analysis

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used

* **Python**
* **Pandas** – for data manipulation
* **NumPy** – for numerical operations
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – for data visualization

## 📁 Notebook Highlights

* **Understanding the Data**: First look at column types, null values, and summary statistics.
* **Cleaning**: Dropped null values (e.g., in `Year` and `Publisher`) to maintain data quality.
* **Visual Analysis**:

  * Top-selling platforms
  * Sales trends over time
  * Regional sales distribution
  * Publisher and genre performance
